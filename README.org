#+TITLE: Build externals for wire-cell packages

The =wire-cell= software in [[https://github.com/BNLIF][BNL IF GitHub]] depends on some software that may not come with your OS, in particular [[http://root.cern.ch][ROOT]].  This package provides a [[https://github.com/brettviren/worch][Worch]] configuration file to build that software.

* Preparation

Of course, you need Worch.  There are various ways to install it and the easiest is via pip in a virtualenv:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ virtualenv venv
  $ source venv/bin/activate
  $ pip install worch
#+END_EXAMPLE

This [[https://github.com/BNLIF/wire-cell-externals][wire-cell-externals]] repository provides the rest of what is needed:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ git clone git@github.com:BNLIF/wire-cell-externals.git /path/to/work
  $ cd /path/to/work
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Build

After the above is done, one command builds the software:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ waf --prefix=/path/to/install --orch-config=worch.cfg \
             configure build
#+END_EXAMPLE

Depending on how fast your computer, this may take on order an hour.
